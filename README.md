# Habit Tracking App

## Steps

1.Initialize a new npm project using npm init.
Install necessary packages, such as express for the server and json-server for the fake database.

2.Create a Fake Database:
Use json-server to create a fake database (db.json) where you can store habit data. 

3.Create an Express Server:
Set up an Express server to handle HTTP requests and serve your Habit Tracking app.
Create routes for handling habit-related operations..

4.Build the Habit Tracking Frontend.
Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for your frontend.
Design a form to input a habit and the time you stopped doing it.

5.Implement JavaScript functions to handle form submissions and interact with the server.
Use AJAX or Fetch API to communicate with the server and perform CRUD operations on habits.
Calculate Days Since Stopped:

6.Implement a function to calculate how many days have passed since you stopped a habit. You can use the current date and the date the habit was stopped.

7.Update the UI dynamically to reflect changes in habits and the number of days since you stopped each habit.
